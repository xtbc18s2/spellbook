# Spellbook

## Day 3 Homework

* In addition to building a list item and adding it to the DOM (as we are now), also store each spell in an array.

### Bonus Credit

* Add a _delete_ button to each list item that removes it from the list.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Remove the item from the array as well.

## Day 2 Homework

* Add a second field of your choice to the form.

### Bonus Credit

Look up `document.createElement` and `appendChild`, and try adding the list items that way, instead of with `innerHTML`.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Display each value in the list item (the name, whatever other field you add) in separate elements, and style them differently somehow.

For example:

```html
<li>
  <span class="spellName">Fireball</span>
  <span class="level">lvl 4</span>
</li>
```

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Build each new element (the `li`, each `span`, etc.) in separate functions.

## Day 1 Homework

* Make the button change the text of the heading (the `<h1>`).

### Bonus Credit

* Add multiple headings to the page, and make the button change the _second_ one. (Use a `class` or an `id`.)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a form to the page.
* Add a text input to the form.
* When the form is _submitted_, update the heading with the text that you type in the text input.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Make sure it works when you press _enter_ on the keyboard, not just when you click the button.
